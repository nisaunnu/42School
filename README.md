<h1> :computer: 42 School </h1>

42 schools offer us a different way of learning about technology and stepping into that world. It is based on the model of students learning from each other without a teacher and a classroom, and allows students to develop their own skills.

To be admitted to the training of 42 schools, you must complete a 26-day training period (C Piscine). Education is completely free. More detailed information can be found at the links below.

<h1> :boom: Skills Developed </h1>
<h3> Hard-Skills </h3>

```markdown
# GIT
Projects made by students are sent to a remote git repository with git version control system commands. 
This system makes students more comfortable.

# Shell
In the early days of C piscine, you learn basic and intermediate shell commands to navigate the terminal 
and do the steps for projects.

# C Language
The language learned in 42's Piscine is C. It allows us to create desired programs, including handling 
variables, pointers, memory allocations, macros, as well as the use and appearance of libraries and 
Makefiles.
```

<h3> Soft-Skills </h3>

```markdown
# Self-learning and Proactivity
42 schools are at the center of self-learning and peer-to-peer learning methodology. Learning process: 
based on your research, questioning your friends, and knowledge situation where each student learns at 
their own pace.

# Teamwork
On weekends, there is a 48 hour team project called "Rush". A group of 3 or 5 members randomly matched by 
the school's system should develop the desired practice. The biggest challenge in Rush projects is to 
synchronize the different levels of information while the work is being carried out, which ensures that 
all team members take an active role in the project.

# Time Management and Flexibility
42 schools are open 24/7. Students are free to work whenever they want, which requires flexibility to be 
productive between excellent time management skill and the workload required by the program.
